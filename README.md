# Excel-Advance-Finance-Analytics

I recently created an Advanced Finance Analytics Excel report based on a real-world business case of AtliQ Hardware, and it was an amazing learning experience.



🏢 About AtliQ Hardware


AtliQ Hardware makes products like PCs, Mouse, and Printers.

 They sell their products through:


🏬 Stores like Croma & Best Buy

🛒 Online platforms like Amazon & Flipkart

🏪 Their own stores (AtliQ Exclusive & E-Store)

🌏 Distributors like Neptune (China & South Korea)



💡 What I Learned



To understand the company’s Profit & Loss (P&L), I worked on:

Net Sales

COGS (Manufacturing + Freight + Other costs)

Gross Margin

Gross Margin %



👉 Example:



 If a mouse is sold for $25 and total cost is $20:

Gross Margin = $5

GM% = Gross Margin / Net Sales



🛠 What I Built in Excel



Advanced financial measures (COGS, GM, GM%)

A clean and interactive Excel dashboard

Fiscal Year logic (AtliQ’s fiscal year starts in September)

Proper month sorting using a Date Dimension table

This project helped me understand how real companies analyze their financial performance using data.
